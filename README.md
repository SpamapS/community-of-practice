# Communities of Practice reading and watching/listening list 
This page contains links to talks, podcasts, books and accademic papers about communities of practice. Inspired by Lorin's reading lists e.g. [Messiness reading list](https://github.com/lorin/messiness)

Communities are fun, amazing, very powerful and are not obvious or easy to understand. These resources will help you with that.

[Strong and Weak Ties](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book-ch03.pdf)

[Rhizomatic Education: Community as Curriculum](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234577448_Rhizomatic_Education_Community_as_Curriculum)

[Communities of practice and social learning systems: the career of a concept](https://wenger-trayner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/09-10-27-CoPs-and-systems-v2.01.pdf) by Etienne Wenger, he’s the one that came up with that concept in the first place. Anything about community with his name on it is generally worth reading.

[The fractal structure of communities of practice: Implications for business organization](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341034794_The_fractal_structure_of_communities_of_practice_Implications_for_business_organization) by Emily Webber and Robin Dunbar

[Structural and Epistemic Parameters in Communities of Practice](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247824282_Structural_and_Epistemic_Parameters_in_Communities_of_Practice) talks about how organisations can support CoPs without constraining them by controlling them in a way that disrupts the dynamics that make the community work in the first place. It differentiates between different structures and the delicate balance between seeding structures and controlling structures. A few teasers:
- CoPs need seeding structure to grow
- Summarises some of the original material from Wenger (he’s awesome!) of what is a CoP and how do you know one has formed.
- importance of artifacts as points of focus for people to identify and interact
- incentives and how they changed over time with a change of the structure
- danger of becoming too introspective losing touch with the wider organisation context
